# O
I have learnt the process of tasking and how to make a context map through the cute number and multiplication table exercise.
# R
Amazed, by how a simple context map could help the design process
# I
At work, there are a few times that I scrap code (for new features) and rebuild them as I encounter difficulties that I did not think of ahead. Such obstacles could often be averted if I spend more time to design and think before start coding. The process of tasking could be a good tool allowing me to design the code in a more comprehensive way.
# D
I should adopt the process of tasking and context map making at work whenever I build new features. So I might reduce the times that I have to scrap and rebuild to prevent time and effort being wasted
